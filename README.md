"An **image classification model** is a deep learning model designed to categorize images into predefined classes. It typically uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to extract spatial features from images. The model consists of **convolutional layers** for feature extraction, **pooling layers** for dimensionality reduction, and **fully connected layers** for classification. **Activation functions like ReLU** introduce non-linearity, while **softmax** in the final layer provides class probabilities. The model is trained using a **dataset** with labeled images and optimized with techniques like **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam**. Performance is evaluated using **accuracy, confusion matrices, and loss functions**. Applications include **object recognition, medical diagnosis, and autonomous driving**."
